# ScriptenApp
A tool to help you learn glsl.
This is very new, a lot of even basic features are lacking, I am working on it 💪🏻

# Run it on MacOS
`git checkout mac` \
`cd targets/macOS/` \
`./scripten-desktop` \

# Run it on Windows10
`git checkout windows` \
`cd targets\windows10` \
`scripten-desktop.exe` \
